**PUE load profile model developed as part of my master's thesis ("Modeling Productive Use Load Profiles for Off-Grid Rural Electrification")**

- Includes analysis of recorded high-resolution load data from a rural microgrid in Madagascar (data is currently not publicly available)
- The model itself relies heavily on the RAMP framework (https://github.com/RAMP-project) with some changes to it's core that are currently not part of the public RAMP repository. To run the model, it is necessary to use this fork of the RAMP repo: https://github.com/JW-Kraft/RAMP
